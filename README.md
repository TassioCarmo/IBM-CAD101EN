#SASS

It is an extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.
SASS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, and inline imports to keep things
organized.

SAAS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.
Another language that is being used now is Learner Style Sheets (LESS) or LESS.

#LESS

enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions. It is backwards compatible with


# A JavaScript framework 

is an application framework that is written in JavaScript.

Programmers can manipulate the different functions, use them wherever required and can create
device responsive applications.
A few examples of several frameworks being used are:
Angular framework: an open-source framework and is being maintained by Google.
Angular frameworks allow websites to render the HTML pages quickly and efficiently.
It has built-in tools for routing and form validation.


React.js has been developed and maintained by Facebook.
It is a JavaScript library that builds and renders components for a web page.
It is not a complete suite of tools.
For example, routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added using
a third-party tool.
React.js only helps build and drop components into a page.


Vue.js is maintained by the community and its main focus is the view layer which includes
user interface, buttons, and visual components.
It is flexible, scalable and integrates well with other frameworks.
It is very adaptable. It can be a library, or it can be the framework.
The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.
